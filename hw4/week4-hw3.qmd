**Overview**: Need to find which observer counted exactly 36 eggs at the “nome” site between 1998 and 2008 inclusive

**Plan**: 

- Bird_eggs table has the number of eggs, year, and site 
- Bird_nests table can join with the Bird_eggs via Nest_ID. From this join we can get observer code from Bird_nests 
- Personnel table has Abbreviation column which can be joined to Observer column from Bird_nests and from there we can extract the actual name of the observer
- Need to find where Bird_nests.ageMethod = 'float'

```{sql}
-- Find observers that worked from 1998 and 2008 
SELECT DISTINCT Observer FROM Bird_nests 
  WHERE Year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2008;
```


```{sql}
-- find which of those observers worked at 'nome' and extract Nest_ID
SELECT Observer, Nest_ID 
  FROM Bird_nests 
  WHERE Site = 'nome'
  AND Year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2008
  AND ageMethod = 'float' 
  AND Observer IS NOT NULL;
```


```{sql}
-- Final query: join to personnel table and find which counted at 36 nests 
SELECT Personnel.Name, COUNT(Bird_nests.Nest_ID) AS Num_floated_nests
  FROM Bird_nests
  JOIN Personnel ON Bird_nests.Observer = Personnel.Abbreviation
  WHERE Bird_nests.Site = 'nome'
  AND Bird_nests.Year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2008
  AND Bird_nests.ageMethod = 'float'
  AND Bird_nests.Observer IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY Personnel.Name
  HAVING COUNT(Bird_nests.Nest_ID) = 36;
```
