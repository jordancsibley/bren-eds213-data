Question: Which sites have no egg data?

1. Using a `Code NOT IN (subquery)` clause 

```{sql}
SELECT Code FROM Site
    WHERE Code NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Site FROM Bird_eggs)
    ORDER BY Code;
```

2. Using an outer join with a WHERE clause 

```{sql}
SELECT Code FROM Site FULL OUTER JOIN Bird_eggs
    ON Code = Site 
    WHERE Egg_num IS NULL
    ORDER BY Code;
```

3. Using the set operation EXCEPT

```{sql}
SELECT Code FROM Site
  EXCEPT 
  SELECT DISTINCT Site FROM Bird_eggs
  ORDER BY Code;
```
