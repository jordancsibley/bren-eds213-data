## Part 1 


```{sql}
-- Demonstrate incorrect code 
SELECT Site_name, MAX(Area) FROM Site; -- binder error 
SELECT Site_name, AVG(Area) FROM Site; -- binder error 
SELECT Site_name, COUNT(*) FROM Site; -- binder error 
SELECT Site_name, SUM(Area) FROM Site; -- binder error 
```

All of these lines of code are popping out a Binder error. In the error message it states '"Site_name" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function. Either add it to the GROUP BY list, or use "ANY_VALUE(Site_name)" if the exact value of "Site_name" is not important.' 


```{sql}
-- Corrected code 
SELECT Site_name, Area
  FROM Site 
  WHERE Area = (SELECT MAX(Area) FROM SITE);
```


This code now works because we have specified that we are trying to exact not just any site, but instead the site where area is the greatest.


## Part 2 

```{sql}
-- find site with max area 
SELECT Site_name, Area From Site
  ORDER BY Area DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```

## Part 3 

```{sql}
-- find site with max area using nested query 
SELECT Site_name, Area FROM Site 
  WHERE Area = (SELECT MAX(Area) FROM Site);
```
